  "temperature": 0.3,
  "instructions": {
    "task": "What the AI should do",
    "output_format": "json",
    "required_fields": ["field1", "field2"]
  },
  "prompt_template": "Your prompt template with {terms} placeholder",
  "validation_rules": {
    "min_confidence": 0.7,
    "required_fields": ["field1", "field2"]
  },
  "output_processing": {
    "filter_by_confidence": true,
    "min_confidence_threshold": 0.7
  }
}
```

- **temperature**: Creativity level (0.0-2.0, lower = more focused)

### Instructions Section
- **task**: Clear description of what the AI should accomplish
- **output_format**: Expected response format (usually "json")
- **required_fields**: Fields that must be present in AI response

- **min_confidence**: Minimum confidence score for valid results
- **required_fields**: Fields that must be present in each result
- **company_indicators**: Keywords that suggest a term is a company

### Output Processing
- **filter_by_confidence**: Whether to filter results by confidence
- **min_confidence_threshold**: Minimum confidence for inclusion

```

## üöÄ Tips for Best Results

1. **Use specific configurations**: Choose the configuration that matches your analysis needs
2. **Provide context**: Include relevant terms that might help the AI understand your domain
3. **Review results**: Always review AI results for accuracy
4. **Adjust confidence thresholds**: Lower thresholds for exploratory analysis, higher for production use
5. **Export results**: Use the export features to save results for further analysis

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No configurations found**: Ensure JSON files are in the `ai_analysis_configs/` directory
- **API key errors**: Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- **Poor results**: Try adjusting the temperature or using a different model
- **Timeout errors**: Reduce the number of terms or use a faster model
